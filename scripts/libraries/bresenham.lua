---
-- Maps a line from point (ox, oy) to point (ex, ey) onto a two dimensional
-- tile grid.
--
-- The callback function will be called for each tile the line passes on its
-- way from the origin to the target tile. The line algorithm can be stopped
-- early by making the callback return false.
--
-- The callback will receive parameters in the following order:
--      callback( ox, oy, counter, ... )
--
-- With ox and oy being the coordinates of the pixel the algorithm is currently
-- passing through, counter being the amount of passed pixels and ...
-- representing variable arguments passed through.
--
-- @tparam number ox The origin's x-coordinates.
-- @tparam number oy The origin's y-coordinates.
-- @tparam number ex The target's x-coordinates.
-- @tparam number ey The target's y-coordinates.
-- @tparam[opt] function callback
--                      A callback function being called for every tile the line passes.
--                      The line algorithm will stop if the callback returns false.
-- @tparam[opt] vararg ...
--                      Additional parameters which will be forwarded to the callback.
-- @treturn boolean     True if the target was reached, otherwise false.
-- @treturn number      The counter variable containing the number of passed pixels.
